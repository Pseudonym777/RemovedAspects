# RemovedAspects
Removed Hades aspects modded back in and made somewhat playable
To use, install using modimporter/modUtil, then switch aspects on bow and select one of the top 2 options

Beam bow has a rapid fire very low damage fast laser attack, and a high damage aerial barrage special.

Charge bow can charge up multiple arrows into one attack, then release with a few bonus projectiles.
It can also dash while charging attack without releasing, and has a wide spread barrage special with low damage
